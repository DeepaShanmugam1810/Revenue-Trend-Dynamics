Walmart, one of the leading retail stores in the US, aims to accurately predict sales and demand. Various events and holidays significantly impact daily sales. Sales data from 45 Walmart stores is available. The company faces challenges with unforeseen demand, leading to stockouts due to inadequate machine learning algorithms. An ideal algorithm would accurately predict demand, considering factors like economic conditions, CPI, and the Unemployment Index.

Throughout the year, Walmart runs several promotional markdown events, especially before major holidays such as the Super Bowl, Labour Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. Sales during these holiday weeks are weighted five times higher than non-holiday weeks in evaluations. A key challenge is modeling the effects of markdowns during these holiday weeks, given the incomplete historical data. Historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores across different regions are available for analysis.
